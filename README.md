## Abstract

**Background:** Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a pulmonary disease with a high mortality rate and a high rate of treatment failure. In humans, the most common pathogen of IA is *A. fumigatus*, however, the virulence factors responsible are insufficiently understood from a quantitative perspective. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between germination rates and prevalence of opportunistic pathogens among different Aspergillus species, however, a study on hyphal growth rates has not been performed before.

**Methods:** Mixed effects exponential and logistic growth models were used to estimate the growth rates of Aspergillus growth and significance testing was performed.

**Results:** No significant difference (p = 0.15) was found for *A. fumigatus growth* with and without epithelial cells. Furthermore, the maximal growth rates of all 3 fungal species used in the study were significantly different from one another at the Bonferroni corrected 0.05 significance level, with that of *A. fumigatus* being the largest (43.39 ± 2.92 for *A. fumigatus*, 8.09 ± 1.05 for *A. tubingensis* and 6.95 ± 0.91 for *A. niger*).

**Conclusion:** Mixed effects growth models were successfully developed which consistently had lower information criteria values and cross validation errors than the complete pooling model, suggesting that the mixed effects model has better generalisation for datasets involving inherent groupings. Results corresponding to *A. fumigatus* grown with and without epithelial cells imply that epithelial cells only have an impact on condia germination, but not on hyphal growth. Additionally, *A. fumigatus* has the highest maximal growth rate among the three species studied which implies that the maximum growth rate is a virulence factor indicative of prevalence in IA.
